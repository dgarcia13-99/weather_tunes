Weather Tunes

"Weather Tunes" asks the user to input a city and returns three Spotify playlist suggestions that match the city's current weather condition. I utilized the GoogleMaps API to access the latitude and longitude components that were then used by the Pirate Weather API to access the location's hourly weather summary. I also utilized Spotify's Web API to search and query playlists that match the tone of the city's current weather conditions. 

HOW TO USE:
-Enter a city
-When you reach the playlist page, you can click on the image of the playlist to take you to the playlist itself on the Spotify.com page
-Refresh the page if you want different playlist options
-Click the "Browse More Playlists" button to access more playlists on Spotify.com that match the city's current weather conditions

Thank you for viewing my project!
